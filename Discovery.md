A chatbot for people who are tired of sophisticated AI like ChatGPT and would
rather talk to an inane, nonsensical bot trained on their own choice of
material.

The bot is trained on The Picture of Dorian Gray by default, but you can
provide your own material in the form of a plain text file. Follow the instructions
in the UI and check the git repository for more information about generating your
own corpus.
